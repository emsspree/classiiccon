# Classiiccons

Mac command line tools for working with *.icns* icon files and image file formats.

+ `geticon` and `seticon` can be used to get and set an icon of a file or folder.
+ `image2icns` and `icns2image` are there to convert icons from/to images.

In January 2022 in wanted to learn more about programming in general and image/icon processing in particular. I found and forked the command line utilities suite [*osxiconutils*](https://github.com/sveinbjornt/osxiconutils), which was developed from 2003 by [Sveinbjorn Thordarson](https://github.com/sveinbjornt), who finally stopped his work on it in 2020. “Created a long time ago” wrote Thordarson.

I renamed it to *Classiiccons* because I found the name appropriate for this “historical” work and I have a weakness for extraordinary unique names.

The *osxiconutils* suite uses [*IconFamily*](http://iconfamily.sourceforge.net/), a Cocoa/Objective-C wrapper for Mac OS X Icon Services’ “IconFamily” data type by Troy Stephens and many other developers.

Just don’t expect anything from this repository. It is just for me to learn and understand. There are plenty of modern ports of the components used here.
